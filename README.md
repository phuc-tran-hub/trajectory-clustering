# trajectory-clustering

The trajectory clustering library is a personal library for trajectory clustering calculations such as abstract distance between two line segments and OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify Cluster Structure) clustering via line segments. 

The library was initially started on June 2021 for a research project with Professor Quattrini Li. In our research, there were new trajectory clustering computations that are not readily available online. It will continue to be developed throughout Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 and be implemented with obstacle avoidance algorithms.
