### Trajectory-Clustering Research

### Description

The trajectory clustering library is a personal library for trajectory clustering calculations such as abstract distance between two line segments and OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify Cluster Structure) clustering via line segments. The library was initially started on June 2021 for a research project with Professor Quattrini Li. In our research, there were new trajectory clustering computations that are not readily available online. The project was finished after the summer internship and used as referenced for future trajectory clustering research for the lab.

### Evaluation

The library was tested in modules. So far, we were happy with the limited samples with random line segment generators. The data was briefly tested with a private AIS datasheet given by Mingi Jeong.
