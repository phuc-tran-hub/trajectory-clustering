### Trajectory-Clustering Research

### Description

The trajectory clustering library is a personal library for trajectory clustering calculations such as abstract distance between two line segments and OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify Cluster Structure) clustering via line segments. The library was initially started on June 2021 for a research project with Professor Quattrini Li. In our research, there were new trajectory clustering computations that are not readily available online. It will continue to be developed throughout Winter 2022 and be implemented with obstacle avoidance algorithms. Currently, we are preprocessing AIS data to fit into our data structures and algorithms.

### Evaluation

The library is currently being tested at every level. So far, we are happy with the limited samples with random line segment generators. However, the true test is to preprocess the data and see the algorithms fit on a real-world context.

### Execution

To compile, contact me for the AIS datasheet and compile any current testing file (linesimulation.py, OPTICSsimulation.py, preprocess.py).
